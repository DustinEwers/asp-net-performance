#Full Stack ASP.NET MVC Performance Tuning

"Performance is a feature" 
- Jeff Atwood

Application performance is often under-appreciated. At least until the user complaints start rolling in. Spending time tweaking your application can be tough to justify to management, but performance is the ultimate feature. Even small increases in performance can drastically improve adoption of your application. Performance impacts the bottom line like a meteorite impacts the Earth. 

In this talk, we're going to explore how to improve the performance of ASP.NET applications from top to bottom. We'll start by looking at ways to find the bottlenecks. Then we'll look at each layer in the stack and fix common performance issues.  You'll leave with a plethora of new tools to tune up your own applications. After this talk, you'll be able to make apps faster than Usain Bolt with cheetahs for shoes.
